This is a sort of WordPress clone built in Nuxt 3 to train my skills. It is built with my own UI Component Library, a GraphQl Database interaction on a Mongo Database.
When finished you can make pages which resolve to url's, you can create your own components in html/vue and are able to upload your own styling.
